# Conceptual overview

> We present here an overview of Git to get an idea what it is and can do. Note that we use commands for the command line to illustrate steps. Later we will describe how this can be done also in VSC.

## Analogy

Imaging a project where you make a digital painting. For the assignment, you know that you need the help of someone else as you are terrible in drawing cats. But you are terribly busy, so you want to continue working on the project while your buddy is drawing a cat. Also, you might want to make edits on earlier parts of the drawing. 

Of course you start with an empty canvas, @fig_tree_1, where you quickly draw a tree on @fig_tree_2.

```

The first two snapshots of your project. You can always go back to earlier versions, e.g. starting with an empty canvas.
````

You draw a background and a sun, where you again make a 'snapshot' of your work @fig_tree_3.

```

Now it is time for your friend to draw the cat @fig_tree_4a while you draw some clouds @fig_tree_4b. 

````{figure}

```

Two branches, each working based on @fig_tree_3
````

When both are happy you combine these two into one main painting, @fig_tree_5. You reconsider step 2 and try to see whether a different background color improves your work, @fig_tree_5a. You'll still have to decide if you are happy with that change, or whether you revert it.

## The tree with branches

The idea of git is often explained using a graph like in @fig_branches. It is called a tree, and it has branches. Every project has a _main_ branch, for a website this could be the files that the actual website is build from. But you might want to develop your website, change its appearance, but without the users of the website experiencing downtime. This is where the branches come in.

You can create a new branch by running
```
git switch -c <name_of_new_branch>
```
in the terminal. This will create a new branch. You can check which branches are available and which is the branch you are working on by running:
```
git branch
```
and subsequently moving between branches by
```
git switch <name_of_branch>
```
Note the difference `-c` which **c**reates a new branch!

An illustration of branching in Git. Inspired by [TTW](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-git-branches/). 
```

In the example given in @fig_branches, one has run `git branch -c dev`, `git branch -c style`, and `git branch -c functest` - not necessarily done by the same person.

When you make a new branch, all files are 'copied'. You can now edit these files in that branch, where the main branch is left intact. After sufficient development and testing you can _merge_ the new branch into the main. In the given example when a new style is developed and approved.

It might also be that some development is needed but the code is not working, or needed anymore. It might become a _stale_ branch then. It can be removed by running:
```
git branch -D <name_of_branch>
```

(sec_merge)=
## Merge
What you also can see is the possibility to synchronize the main branch to any of the newly made branches, see @fig_merge. If you do this locally, you always have to verify that your local files are up-to-date:
```
git switch main
git pull origin main
```
After that you can _merge_:
```
git switch <new-branch>
git merge main
```

An example of merging. 
```

When merging to _main_ you see in @fig_branches check marks. We are able to protect branches and specify rules. For instance, one has to review the code first before allowing to merge. This protects the continuity of the main output. This is then called a _merge request_ (GitLab) or a _pull request_ (GitHub).

```

(sec_merge_confl)=
## Merge conflict
It might happen that two people (or you in two different branches) have made changes in the same file. We might then hit a _merge conflict_, where git is not sure which edits to keep and which to discard (or keep both).
